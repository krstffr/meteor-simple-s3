# Yes a readme would be S-W-E-E-T

This package uses a lot of dependencies. So if that's not your thing, don't use it.

## Example

The example app is using the old ```mrt```/```smart.json``` for including the package by path "../.." instead of the package on atmosphere. This is to make it easier to add new features. Run ```mrt update``` in the example folder to add the package!
